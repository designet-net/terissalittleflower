                        St. Luke tells the story of King Herod’s persecution of the early Church; how, after he beheaded James the brother of John and saw that this pleased the Jews, he decided to arrest Peter as well.

                        Here we have the revealed teaching of the Holy Spirit, as a practice (for Peter) and a petition (by Paul) that among the duties of a Christian, one is to pray for priests. Surely if Peter, the first Pope, and Paul, the Apostle to the Gentiles, needed prayers, how much more their successors in the papacy, episcopate and the priesthood are in dire need of our unceasing prayers in this chaotic generation where the forces of darkness are unleashed against the Church!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We can ask the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity, to guide all priests as they live out their vocation. Also, we can ask the intercession of Mary, Mother of All Priests, St. Therese the Little Flower and St. John Vianney, Patron Saints of priests.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In days past in some parts of the world, it was customary to set aside one Saturday of the month as a day devoted to praying for priests. This would be a beautiful custom to bring back! When Pope Benedict XVI emphasised Eucharistic Adoration for the sanctification of the clergy, the emphasis has been placed on Thursday adoration hours!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       O Jesus, Eternal High Priest, have mercy on your priests!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is a call for every Catholic to have a heart to pray for the chosen souls who are entrusted with the salvation of our souls but are human beings with human weaknesses.

                     Most merciful Father, I offer Thee the prayers,  works,  joys,  and  sufferings   of this day by placing them in the holy and venerable  hands  of  Jesus,  the   Eternal High  Priest,  and  by  saying,  as  He  did upon entering the world,  “Behold,  I  come to do Thy will”(Hebrews  10:9).  For  the sake of  all  His  priests,  and  in  particular for the priests entrusted to my intercession,(mention the names)I entreat Thy beloved Son to  unite  my  offering  to the Sacrifice of the Cross, renewed upon
                    the altars of Thy Church from the rising of the sun to its setting(Malachi 1:11)<br>.Holy Father, look upon these men chosen by Thy Son to show forth His death until He comes (1 Corinthians 11:26); keep them from the Evil One (John 17:15) and sanctify them in the truth (John 17:17). Bind them by a most tender love to the Virgin Mary their Mother, that by her intercession, they may be overshadowed by the power of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35) in every act of their sacred ministry; thus may their priesthood reveal the Face of Jesus and the merciful love of His Heart, for the fruitfulness of His Spouse, the Church and the praise of Thy glory. Amen. By Father Mark Kirby, OSB
