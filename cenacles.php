                    Therese the Little Flower Apostolate also encourages men both religious and the laity who desire to join the spirituality of praying for priests, to join “Therese and Vianney” cenacles. These cenacles are groups of men and women affiliated with the Apostolate of Spiritual Motherhood and, placing themselves under the intercession of St. Therese and St. Vianney, the Patron Saints for priests, come together to pray for priests and vocations. Taking inspiration from the Congregation of the clergy’s 2012 publication of the “Eucharistic Adoration for the Sanctification of Priests and Spiritual Maternity”, we have introduced both private and public Therese and Vianney Cenacles in order to magnify the Congregation’s worldwide initiative of intercessory prayer for priests, especially through Eucharistic Adoration.

                    There is a number of our brothers and fathers devoted to praying for priests but since the Apostolate has been designed to spiritual adoption of priests by women only, they seemed discouraged. Therese and Vianney cenacles are set up to solve this problem. The Cenacles are such a power house, which strengthens the Apostolate by assisting priests and spiritual mothers with their prayers too!

                    We have a booklet to help in this spirituality which has been approved by the Archdiocese of Kampala. This will help anyone interested in this Apostolate.

                   Our Blessed Lord will reward immeasurably anyone who offers herself to help his chosen souls as it was with the widow who cared for the Prophet Elijah (1Kings 17:7-16)

                   It is important to know that spiritual motherhood is not a vocation in itself. It does not replace the married state, the consecrated life, or celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom. Spiritual motherhood is a vocation “within a vocation” for women who discern a calling to assist priests in their vocation and pastoral ministry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   The first and foremost duty for any Christian is to answer the universal call to holiness within their particular state of life. After answering that call, then, women may choose to assist priests by being spiritual mothers. The same applies to all men and women who want to be part of the Therese and Vianney cenacles.
